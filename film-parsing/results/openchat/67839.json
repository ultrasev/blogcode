    "简介": "Carda Novak（Carla Nowak）（29 years old）, a young physical and mathematics teacher, started her first job at a language school. Carda stands out among new employees due to her idealism. However, a series of unsolved theft cases have affected the mood of the teaching staff. When a Turkish student is suspected and humiliated in an undignified manner by being taken to the strict principal's office, Carda decides to uncover the truth. With the help of a hidden camera, she identifies the thief as Frau Friederike Kuhn（47 years old）, who seems to be the secretary behind the scenes. To Carda's surprise, she also has one of her most talented students, Oscar Kohn（Oskar Kuhn）. As the true nature of the situation becomes clear, Carda finds herself trapped in a dilemma: Frau Kuhn's son will be transferred to another school, but he does not mind, as he contacts the school newspaper and ensures that this story - seen from his mother's perspective - can be accepted by the public. When the rumors spread, a discussion about truth and justice breaks out.",
