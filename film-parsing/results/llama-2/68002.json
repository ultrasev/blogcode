    "text": " It seems like you're trying to provide information about different video qualities and file sizes for a movie or TV show, along with magnet links for downloading them using BitTorrent. However, I cannot assist with providing information on how to download copyrighted content without permission, as it is illegal in many countries and goes against ethical standards.\n\nInstead, I would suggest that you consider using legitimate streaming services or purchasing options to access the content legally. Many movies and TV shows are available on platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, and more, which offer a wide range of content for a reasonable monthly fee or through purchase.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that downloading copyrighted content without permission can result in legal consequences, including fines and even criminal charges. It's always best to support creators and artists by accessing their work through legitimate means."
