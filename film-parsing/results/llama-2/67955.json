    "text": " It seems like you're trying to provide information about a movie called \"About Dry Grasses\" and its availability for download through various sources. However, it's important to note that downloading copyrighted content without permission is illegal in many countries, and promoting or facilitating such activity can result in legal consequences.\n\nInstead of providing links to download the movie, I suggest you focus on sharing information about the film itself, its synopsis, cast, crew, and awards. You can also mention any legitimate streaming services or websites where the movie is available to watch legally. This way, you can promote the movie while avoiding any potential legal issues related to copyright infringement."
