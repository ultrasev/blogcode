It tells the true story of the von Erich family, a dynasty of wrestlers who rose to fame in the 1980s. The film follows the lives of the six von Erich brothers, who were trained by their father, Fritz, to become professional wrestlers. The eldest son, Kerry, died at the age of 33 due to an accidental drug overdose, while the other five brothers went on to have successful careers in the sport. However, their personal struggles and tragedies continued to haunt them, with four of the remaining five brothers dying prematurely due to various causes such as suicide, drug overdoses, and car accidents. Only the youngest brother, Kevin, survived and retired from wrestling to live a quiet life with his family.\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including Zac Efron as Kevin von Erich, Taylor Nichols as Fritz von Erich, and Lily James as Pam, a love interest of one of the brothers.
