    "text": " It seems like you're trying to share information about a movie called \"Hello Ghost\" and provide download links for it. However, I cannot assist with downloading copyrighted content or promoting piracy in any way. It is important to respect the intellectual property rights of creators and adhere to copyright laws.\n\nInstead, I suggest searching for legitimate streaming services that offer the movie for rent or purchase. There are many platforms available that support legal video streaming, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Disney+, and more. By choosing to watch movies through these channels, you can help ensure that the creators receive fair compensation for their work.\n\nAdditionally, if you have any questions or concerns about the movie itself, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide information without promoting piracy."
