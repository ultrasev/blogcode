    "text": " It seems like you're trying to provide information about a TV show or movie called \"Expats,\" but the text is written in an unusual format that includes HTML code and magnet links for downloading the episodes via BitTorrent. I cannot recommend or provide access to copyrighted content, so I won't be able to assist with this request.\n\nInstead, I would suggest searching for legitimate streaming services or websites where you can watch the show legally. There are many platforms available that offer a wide range of TV shows and movies, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Apple TV+, Disney+, and more. You may also check if your local library offers DVD copies of the show or if there are any free screenings in your community.\n\nRemember that piracy is illegal and can result in serious legal consequences. It's important to respect the intellectual property rights of creators and producers by accessing their work through authorized channels only."
