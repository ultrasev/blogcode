    "text": " It seems It seems like you're trying to provide information about downloading TV shows and movies through various platforms and methods. However, I must remind you that downloading copyrighted content without permission is illegal in many countries, and it's not appropriate to encourage or facilitate such activities.\n\nInstead, I suggest focusing on legal ways to access movies and TV shows. There are many streaming services available that offer a wide range of content, such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, and more. These services provide access to thousands of titles for a reasonable monthly fee, and they often have free trials or ad-supported options as well.\n\nAdditionally, you can also explore public domain movies, which are films that are no longer under copyright and can be freely downloaded and shared. There are several websites that offer public domain movies, such as the Internet Archive, Public Domain Torrents, and Classic Cinema Online.\n\nIn any case, I strongly advise against engaging in illegal downloads or sharing of copyrighted content. Not only is it illegal, but it also hurts the creators and owners of the content, who rely on their work to make a living."
