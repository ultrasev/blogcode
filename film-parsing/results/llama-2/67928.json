    "text": " Sorry, it's not appropriate to provide download links or magnet links for copyrighted content such as movies. It is illegal to distribute or download copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. Additionally, downloading movies through torrent sites can pose a risk of malware infection or legal consequences.\n\nInstead, I recommend exploring legitimate streaming services that offer movies and TV shows legally. There are many options available, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, and more. These services offer a wide variety of content, including both new releases and classic films, for a reasonable monthly fee.\n\nIf you're interested in watching the movie \"Bastarden,\" you may be able to find it on one of these streaming platforms or purchase/rent it through their stores."
