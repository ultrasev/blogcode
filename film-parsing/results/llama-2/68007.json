    "text": " It seems like you're trying to provide information about a TV show or movie called \" Constellation,\" but the text is written in an unusual format that includes HTML codes and magnet links for downloading the episodes via BitTorrent. Additionally, there are references to Chinese video sharing websites such as Youku, TikTok, and Bilibili.\n\nHere's a summary of what I can understand from the text:\n\n* The show is called \"Constellation\" and has three episodes available.\n* Each episode is available in 1080p resolution with H264 encoding.\n* There are multiple ways to download each episode, including magnet links and URLs for various video sharing websites.\n* Some of the URLs include encryption keys or passwords, while others require extraction using tools like 7-Zip.\n* The author encourages readers to scan a QR code or search for \"影的后花园\" (which translates to \"Backyard of Shadows\") on WeChat to follow their public account.\n\nI cannot verify whether the provided links or magnets work correctly or if they contain any malicious content. Therefore, it's important to exercise caution when downloading files from unverified sources, especially those that use P2P file sharing protocols like BitTorrent."
