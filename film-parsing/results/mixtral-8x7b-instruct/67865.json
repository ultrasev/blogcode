The titles mentioned include \"留校联盟\" (The Holdovers) and \"熟肉\" (Meatball), both of which appear to be Chinese dramas or films.\n\nIf someone is interested in downloading these files, they can simply click on the link that corresponds to their preferred format and storage service. For example, if someone wants to download a high definition version of \"The Holdovers\" without subtitles, they could use the magnet link with the hash `a278f45aa28777915abc0991f3da566034df5059` and choose a BitTorrent client to manage the download.
