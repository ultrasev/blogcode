The links are available on both Xunlei Pan and Baidu Netdisk, along with their respective extraction codes or passwords. Additionally, you have provided magnet links for torrent downloads without specifying any particular video quality or subtitles.\n\nIt is important to note that sharing copyrighted content without proper authorization may be against the law in some jurisdictions. I would recommend checking your local laws regarding file sharing before proceeding. Furthermore, it is always a good idea to support creators by watching their work legally through authorized channels if possible."
