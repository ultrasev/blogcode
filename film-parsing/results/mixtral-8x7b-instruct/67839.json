With the help of a hidden surveillance camera, she identifies the culprit: surprisingly it's the school secretary Friederike Kuhn. But when the crime is discovered, Carla finds herself in an untenable position: Friederike Kuhn is also the mother of her most talented student Oscar. She becomes isolated within the institution while feeling responsible for Oscar's psychological burden as he is now labeled 'the thief's son'. The educational establishment offers a simple solution: Oscar will be transferred to another school. He doesn't mind but seeks contact with the school newspaper to ensure public acceptance of this story.",
