Using a low-key perspective, it revealed how two teenagers, represented by Ao Tzu and Ao Guo, were shaped by their experiences in a violent environment that lacked closure. Their lives were filled with obscene language and unresolved acts of violence, including murder, arson, drug addiction, and senseless idealism. The storyline is characterized by a somber tone and long, steady camera shots, which effectively conveyed the bleak reality of Taiwanese cinema at the time. The music score and insert songs contributed significantly to the overall mood of despair and emptiness. This depiction of rebellious young people and their association with organized crime led to both opportunities and challenges for Xu Shaoming's future career. In 1992, he was selected as one of the closing directors at the Cannes Film Festival Director's Fortnight, and also received the Special Recommendation Award at the Montreal World Film Festival.\n\nDownload Links:\nPan.quark.cn: <https://pan.quark.cn/s/886d102ae3ee>\nXunlei Cloud: <https://pan.xunlei.com/s/VNrKGo9ZjahERweBq7buVZ14A1?pwd=atu3>\n\nMagnet links:\nWithout subtitles: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:d85778f2282648a0c1c0835bdd8d49e7b72dd990&dn=%E5%B0%91%E5%B9%B4%E5%90%94%EF%BC%8C%E5%AE%89%E5%95%A6%EF%BC%81.1992.HD1080P.AAC.H264.CHT-ENG.BTSJ6\nWith Traditional Chinese Subtitles: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:4d1edfd1a966962c4603df1f602ea216b1755038&dn=Dust.of.Angels.1992.1080p."
