    "text": " It seems like you're sharing information about the TV show \"Monarch of Monsters\" and providing download links for various versions with different subtitle options on both Baidu Pan and BitTorrent magnets. The first set of links are for Spanish Latin subtitles in 1080p resolution using Apple TV as the video source, while the second set is for simple English, Chinese (simplified), and Chinese (traditional) subtitles in 2160p resolution also sourced from Apple TV. Additionally, there are two variations available for each language group - one with Atmos audio and H.265 codec, and another with DTS-VDHD audio and H.265 codec.\n\nTo access these files via magnet links, users need a torrent client such as qBitTorrent or Deluge to open the link directly within the application. Alternatively, they can copy the magnet link and paste it into their preferred torrent client manually. Once the download completes, users will have an archive file containing all episodes of the season with the specified subtitle and video quality."
