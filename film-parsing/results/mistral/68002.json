    "text": " It seems like you're providing magnet links for various versions of the TV show \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" in different video qualities and formats. These magnets can be used with BitTorrent clients to download the files from peers sharing them on the torrent network. I see both subbed (embedded or separate) and dubbed versions available in multiple resolutions, including 1080p, 2160p, and HDR.\n\nIf someone is interested in downloading any of these versions, they just need a BitTorrent client such as qBitTorrent, Deluge, or uTorrent, among others. They should copy one of the provided magnet links into their client and start the download process. Keep in mind that using torrents may infringe copyright laws depending on your jurisdiction and personal use intentions. Always make sure to obtain media legally if possible."
