Additionally, you mentioned that there are two versions of the anime available - one with embedded Chinese or multiple subtitles (named \"熟肉\") and another without any subtitles or with internal Chinese subs (named \"生肉\"). The instructions on how to access these versions vary between each link. Finally, you encouraged readers to follow your public WeChat account named \"影的后花园\" or search for it using ID \"BluFilm\"."
