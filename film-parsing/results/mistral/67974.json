Truman Capote (Tom Hollander) becomes close to a group of elite women, known as ‘Swans’, who defined the upper echelons of New York society in the past. These beautiful and influential women include Barbara ‘Babe’ Paley (Naomi Watts), Nancy ‘Slim’ Keith (Diane Lane), C.Z. Guest (Chloë Sevigny), and Lee Radziwill (Calista Flockhart). Capote is deeply attracted to these women and befriends them, but ultimately betrays them by revealing their private secrets in his fictional work. His planned novel 'Answered Prayers' exposes their lives to public scrutiny, leading him to being ostracized from the social circle he adored, plunging him into self-destruction.\n\nDownload links:\n\nNetdisk download: <https://pan.quark.cn/s/3c8b2d84fafe> (includes Season 1)\nSubtitles: English & Chinese hardsubbed MP4 1080P\n\nTorrent Magnet link: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:85F5E35A54EEB1265D38C3094819E3B178C29DBD&dn=The+Capote+Tapes+%28S02%29+%5B1080p+Eng+Chn+Hardsub%5D+%5BTORRENT%5D.torrent\n\nAliyun disk:\nEpisode 1: <https://www.alipan.com/s/o8ZCyzsL1ix>\nEpisode 2: <https://www.alipan.com/s/7Pn4EidoPM7>\n\nXunlei cloud:\nEpisode 1: <https://pan.xunlei.com/s/VNpcRfC6gVb_xvxuxMdPtbKhA1?pwd=jtvn#>\nEpisode 2: <https://pan.xunlei.com/s/VNphOdAunSp_YJEFH510OtQoA1?pwd=r2m2#>\n\nBaidu disk:\nEpisode 1: <https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uRYIS6HNHMMJnJjsZy7_8Q?pwd=b07j> Password: b07j\nEpisode"
