Among these hidden valleys is the home of Hatidze Muratova and her ailing mother. The two live off the land, their livelihood coming from the honey they produce in the forests around them. However, when a nomadic family moves into the area with seven children and a multitude of farm animals, their peaceful existence is disrupted. Not only do they have to deal with the noise and chaos brought about by the large family, but also with the greedy neighbors who ransack their beehives for every last drop of honey. Over three long years, we observe this secretive way of life as it struggles to maintain its balance between nature and mankind, illuminated by the gentle light of dawn and the soft glow of lanterns at dusk.
