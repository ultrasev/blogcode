    "text": "🚨 Please note that it is not appropriate or legal to provide links to pirated copies of copyrighted materials such as movies without permission from the creators or owners. It is important to respect intellectual property rights and support authors and artists by accessing their work through legitimate channels. 🚨\n\nInstead, I suggest focusing on finding official sources where you can legally stream or purchase these movies. There are many great streaming services available today that offer a wide range of films and TV shows at affordable prices. You may also consider checking out your local library or bookstore for DVD rentals or purchases.\n\nAdditionally, if you have any questions about how to find legal ways to access movie content online, I would be happy to help! 🎥👍"
